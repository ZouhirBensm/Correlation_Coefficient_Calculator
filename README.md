# Correlation_Coefficient_Calculator
Code inspired from a book Calculates the correlation coefficients between a two object properties. More details in Read me file!

Correlations are important for several reasons. One of them is the fact that is allows a better understanding of complexe systems. The likelihood of a parameter effecting another one enables professionals of different domains to draw conclusions. This project was a terrific way to deeply understand how functions operate on data -array of objects. Also I learned to a new level how properties from objects or how elements from arrays can be easily destructured. Breaking these complexe sources of data into little particles allow for a better ability and flexebility to compute and make otherwise difficult calculations. Loops enable flexibility in terms of flow. Recursion was heavily used in this project. Also an instance of a call stack was unvisible in a block of code but having a thorough understanding of how code operates I was able to conceptually grasp the phenomena..

The major data input for the 04_08.js source code was issued from the journal.js. The JSON formatted journal.js file contains the array of objects. Each object is composed of two properties. One property is an array called event. The array is made of elements of type String. The second property is a boolean value: squirrel.

The goal is to compute through functions the correlation coefficient between the boolean squirrel and one element of the array -The array being a property of a larger object-
Note: The element can repeat itself as a array element of a property of another objet (if that makes sense!)  

Code was inspired from a book: Eloquent Javascript by Marijn Haverbeke

Please do not hesitate to run the code to take a look at the consol.log() outputs on the console. 

Running the program:

Step 0:

Download the source code. Make note of the path it was downloaded in.

Step 1:

Read the source code with the comments on GitHub, your favorite text editor or IDE!

Step 2:

If you are running mac os as I am, simply install node.js. 

Step 3:

In terminal type: node /Users/username/Downloads/04_08.js

Step 4:

Look at the outputs and re-run the program to see that any input in the source code generates the right output on the console!


Thank you!
